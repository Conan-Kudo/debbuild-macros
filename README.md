# debbuild-macros

This repository is a set of experimental RPM macros for [debbuild](https://github.com/ascherer/debbuild),
designed in such a manner that it's trivial to port RPM packaging to build Debian packages that are
mostly in-line with Debian Policy.

At this point, some of them somewhat work, and some don't work as intended.
